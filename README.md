In my assessment i was given appointments functionality basically to do CRUD operations for patient appointments 

for this i have added three files

front -- UI part based on angular
yuvanshu -- backend api based on java spring boot 
dumps -- it has sql file to setup database 


to run the project -- 

we have to first download and setup openjdk in our system and then in intellij or any any other spring boot compatible ide editor to run we have to open api part 
which is covered under yuvanshu named directory ,then import database using the dump file , run the api and then install and setup node.js in system and then download angular in 
system and in vs code run the ui part which is placed in front directory
